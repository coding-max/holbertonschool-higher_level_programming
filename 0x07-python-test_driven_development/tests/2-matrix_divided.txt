#ZeroDivisionError

    ### div canâ€™t be equal to 0

    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)

#General Case

    ### All elements of the matrix should be divided by div, rounded to 2 decimal places

    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
